READ ME - Alison Ostlund Final Project - Seattle

This project is a graphic replica of the Seattle,WA skyline. The design and placement of all the buildings was inspired by the “Seattle.jpg” picture attached in the folder. The project features the Space needle, personalized built city buildings with lots of different textures, some evergreen tress around the city, a moving ferry boat, and a day/night feature of the city. The lighting is fixed to show the city lights at night time. I love the city I come from and I hope this project reflects that!
